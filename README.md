I couldn't find this on the Visual Studio gallery - so just whipped this up. An unofficial repackaging where just the targeted version of Visual Studio has been updated to 2013 (including Community 2013). Seems to work so far....

Original overview...

#Perspectives
Perspectives - 2013 allows Visual Studio 2013 users to select and manager Visual Studio windows configurations. This works much the same as perspectives in Eclipse.

Version 2.0
* Added a toolbar for quick access to window configurations
* Added support for favorite configurations that show up on the quick access bar
* Added a refresh button to perspectives manager so that you could refresh the view of the configurations were missing
* Reworked the entire perspectives manager window so that it looks much better

Features
* View available perspectives
* Apply perspectives
* Add new perspectives
* Update perspectives
* Delete perspectives
